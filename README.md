# About me

My name is Evgeny from St. Petersburg, but now I live in Kazan. In January 2021, I decided to change my profession(I was an engineer) and since April I have been studying programming at school 21(aka Ecole 42). I am interested in Devops and ML.  

In my free time I like to running, to watch movies and series, to read books, to listen to music and also dance hustle a little.
