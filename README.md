# **About me**

My name is Evgeny from St. Petersburg, but now I live in Kazan. In January 2021, I decided to change my profession(I was an engineer) and since April I have been studying programming at school 21(aka Ecole 42). I am interested in Devops and ML.  

In my free time I like to running, to watch movies and series, to read books, to listen to music and also dance hustle a little.

# I learn this course because:
* I am interested in Devops and I think that this is one of the most promising industries in IT for the near future at least
* It's faster and easier to learn something new when you can ask people for advice if it's necessary
* Even if I don't become a Devops engineer in the future, the methods and practices on which Devops is built will be useful to me

# What I expect from this course:
* Basic knowledge and skills required to work as a Devops engineer in 2021
* Understanding what requirements are imposed on Devops engineers in modern companies and what tasks they solve
* A little help in studying this difficult but interesting direction in IT üòÅ
